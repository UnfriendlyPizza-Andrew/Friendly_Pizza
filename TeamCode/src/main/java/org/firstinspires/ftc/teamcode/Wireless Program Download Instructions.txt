How to Install Android Apps Over WiFi:

Mac Start Here:
1. In terminal, type (adds adb to your path)
    echo 'export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools' >> ~/.bash_profile
    source ~/.bash_profile
    adb devices (test to see if adb is working)
        if terminal says adb is invalid command, restart android studio
2. Continue to "After ADB Path Set"

Windows Start Here:
1. In command prompt, type (adds adb to your path)
    setx PATH "%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools"
    adb devices (test to see if adb is working)
        if terminal says adb is invalid command, restart android studio
2. Continue to "After ADB Path Set"

After ADB Path Set:
1. Make sure Driver Station phone and Robot Controller phone (RC) are connected using wifi direct (make sure RC phone hosts group)
2. Connect to RC's wifi direct network (use group password)
3. Connect RC via usb to computer
4. In cmd or terminal, type
	adb devices (to find current connected usb devices)
        if you get "adb is not a recognized...", restart android studio or your computer
	adb tcpip 5555
5. Disconnect RC from computer
6. In the Robot Contoller App on RC-
    On the home screen, tap the 3 dots, then tap "About"
    Under "Network Information", you will see "IP Address"
    You will need the ip address listed there in the next step
7. In android studio terminal, type
    adb connect <ip address>:5555 (example: adb connect 192.168.49.1:5555)
    adb devices (to find if phone connected)
8. Yay! If you followed the instructions, you should be able to download and install programs over wifi :-)

***Please note, if you connect to another wifi network, you may have to start this process again***
Also keep in mind that you will not have internet access while you are doing this (unless you have multiple wifi adapters)
